        <p> My name is <%= @name %>. I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at <b>Unicentro</b>, a university located in <b>Guarapuava, Paran√°</b>.<br>
        I am in my final semester and anticipate completing my studies in March.</p>

        <p> In addition to my academic pursuits, I am working as a <b>Trainee Developer</b> at <b>CodeMiner42</b>.<br>
        This role is providing me with valuable insights into the industry and helping me apply the theoretical knowledge I've gained during my studies.</p>
    
        <p> My leisure activities encompass a variety of interests.<br> 
        I am particularly fond of video gaming, with titles such as Quantum Break, Hollow Knight, Fortnite and Forza are among my favorites.<br>
        Additionally, I enjoy consuming digital content, which includes watching series and YouTube videos, as well as immersing myself in the literary world through novels.<br>
        And recently, I have also embarked on a fitness journey and have incorporated regular gym sessions into my routine.</p>
